    <h1> Strive for 5 Challenge </h1>
    <p>
    <b>The Strive-for-5 Challenge promotes self-awareness, which is required for developing our emotional maturity. Being the 5 is having a willingness to grow, the courage to be vulnerable with others, and being self-reflective. 
<br>
<br>
As research suggests, it takes 21 days to form a new habit. The first 3 weeks serve as practice for personal growth. The final week will put your emotional development to the test. 
<br>
<br>

This challenge is about stepping outside of your comfort zone. We have purposely created some tasks to sound ambiguous, as an opportunity for you to interpret them in a way that resonates most profoundly with you.
